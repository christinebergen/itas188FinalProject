# **Idea: Home Movie Catalogue within an app**

Having recently obtained a digital copy of old family movies from my childhood, I want to create an app that will make accessing and watching these videos easier and so it can be done from anywhere. I also want to make it easily shared with my family members. I have a binder full of information that explains what is on each video segment, along with details about the date, location, and who was there. I'd like to turn this paper record into an electronic record to preserve it and add another backup location. I currently have approx 45 hours of video (30 tapes that have been converted to digital files) that will need to be edited and compiled. My goal would be to start with 2 to 3 hours of video and have complete for this project. I believe this is a realistic goal to have complete in time for the project deadline.

## This will include: 
 - Programming code so that it selects sections of video based on time stamp.
 - Uploading video clips to a cloud server (currently exploring using private youtube links). Potentially requiring up to about 100GB of storage if I were to upload all of the videos I have, but could start with a smaller amount as maybe not all videos need to be uploaded to be shared.
  
## Android phone features to be used:
 - Internet permissions will be used to play videos.
 - Some form of database (local or mySQL?) will also be needed to store the video clip text and youtube URLs.
